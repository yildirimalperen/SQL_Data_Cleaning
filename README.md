# SQL_Data_Cleaning

As far as I learn there are 5 main stages in data analysis.

* Step 1: The first and most important step is to define the problem and target for analysis.
* Step 2: Collecting the data for the solution.
* Step 3: Data cleaning
* Step 4: Determination of analysis
* Step 5: Finally, visualization and interpretation of results.

I practiced with data cleaning for my portfolio. This was a glimpse to data cleaning but I tried to understand the perspective with different methods. I applied these methods and gained experience with cleaning data.

* Standardization of formats for date and time columns
* Population proper forms for required columns
* Breaking out into individual columns
* Changing texts, removing duplicates and unused rows.
